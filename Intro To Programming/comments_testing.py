#Are you sure this line won't show up?

#You can test what's wrong with your code by
#Putting a # in front of your line of code
#then saving it and testing it to see which line
#is giving you an error.
#Just like this example below 
#
#print('hello it's a small world')
print("hello it's a small world")
#
#Since there's a single quote in the word "it's" 
#the line is giving an error so you need to use the double quote
#Keyboard shortcuts
